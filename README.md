# WeedTrackr: Precision Weed Management System

1st Place Winner - 2025 AIFS √ó Sony AI AgTech Challenge

## üå± The Problem We're Solving

Weed management is a critical challenge facing modern agriculture, with profound economic and environmental implications:

- **$33 billion** in annual U.S. crop yield losses due to weed competition
- **$6 billion** in additional control measure costs each year
- **70 million pounds** of herbicides wasted through imprecise application
- Conventional methods rely on blanket treatments, applying uniform chemical amounts regardless of actual weed distribution
- Precision equipment exists but is expensive and designed primarily for row crops
- In vineyards and orchards, mowing between rows is common, but weeds along rows remain problematic

## üöú Our Solution: WeedTrackr

WeedTrackr is a low-cost AI weed-monitoring system designed specifically for planning herbicide sprays in orchards and vineyards that:

- **Automates weed scouting** during regular maintenance activities
- **Creates precision spray maps** based on actual weed distribution
- **Reduces herbicide use** by up to 90% through targeted application
- **Minimizes environmental impact** and promotes sustainable farming
- **Saves time and money** by eliminating manual scouting and reducing chemical use
- **Works passively** alongside existing maintenance procedures

## üîç How It Works

### Simple 3-Step Process

1. **Mount** WeedTrackr onto your mower or tractor
2. **Power on** the image-collection system
3. **Continue with normal activities** ‚Äî WeedTrackr works autonomously in the background

### Technical Workflow

#### Detect ‚Üí Classify ‚Üí Plan

- **Detect:** WeedTrackr uses a Raspberry Pi with the AI-enabled camera and Spresense GPS module to capture geolocated images as you move through your field
- **Classify:** The onboard AI model processes images in real-time to identify and categorize weeds (broadleaf vs. grass) and distinguish them from soil
- **Plan:** The WeedTrackr dashboard generates intelligent spray route planning and application maps based on weed density and distribution

## üß† Machine Learning Model

Our custom weed classification model is built on a modified MobileNetV2 architecture, optimized for edge deployment.

### Model Architecture

We use two model architectures:
- **WeedNet (Primary)**: Modified MobileNetV2 optimized for low-power edge devices
- **Tiny ResViT (Experimental)**: Hybrid ResNet-Vision Transformer for improved accuracy

### Dataset

Our model is trained on a diverse dataset consisting of:
- **500+** images of broadleaf weeds
- **500+** images of grass weeds
- **1,000+** images of soil and background scenes

All images are augmented with various transformations to improve model robustness:
- Random crops and rotations
- Horizontal and vertical flips
- Brightness, contrast, and color adjustments
- Gaussian blur

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 94.2% |
| Inference Time | 35ms (IMX500) |

## üîß Hardware Configuration

WeedTrackr combines affordable, off-the-shelf components with custom integration software:

### Core Components

- **Raspberry Pi Zero + AI Camera** for system control, data management, and vision
- **Sony Spresense** GPS module for precise geolocation

## üíª Software Architecture

WeedTrackr's software stack consists of three main components:

### 1. Edge AI System (Raspberry Pi + IMX500)

The edge component runs directly on the device mounted to farm equipment and handles:

- Real-time image capture and preprocessing
- On-device weed classification using the optimized model
- GPS data integration and geolocation tagging

### 2. Web Dashboard (React + TypeScript)

The frontend dashboard provides farmers with:

- Intuitive visualization of weed distribution across fields
- Precision spray planning with estimated chemical savings
- Historical treatment records and effectiveness tracking
- Recommendations for herbicide selection based on weed types

## üîÑ Model Optimization for Edge Deployment

Converting our trained PyTorch model to run efficiently on the camera sensor requires several optimization steps:

1. **Training in PyTorch** with MobileNetV2 architecture
2. **Quantization** to reduce model size and improve inference speed
   - Post-training quantization using MCT (Model Compression Toolkit)
   - INT8 precision for weights and activations
3. **ONNX Conversion** for hardware compatibility
4. **IMX500 Packaging** for deployment on the intelligent vision sensor

```
